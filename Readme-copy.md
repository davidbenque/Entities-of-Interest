_Entities of Interest_ is a publication based on the Panama Papers graph-database released by the Internation Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ). This database is essentially a very big diagram (1.040.535 nodes connected by 3.071.104 relationships) which was used collaboratively by hundreds of journalists worldwide to 'connect the dots' between rich and powerful people, and the offshore shell companies they use to hide money from taxes. Backed by the actual documents from the leak—emails, PDFs, passport scans, etc—a few nodes and connections in this graph have led to high impact news stories, for example forcing the prime minister of Iceland to resign.

(visualisation: [Linkurious](https://linkurio.us/))

Outside of these focused high-value areas of the graph, thousands of companies, "officers", and "intermediaries" did not get any press coverage; they took part in the offshore finance system without breaking any laws, or being public figures, or simply took enough care to cover their tracks. 

~~With many of the corprate entities in the data already marked as "dead", "defaulted", or otherwise de-activated at the time of the leak in 2015, the ICIJ graph is becoming a digital ruin.~~ Additionally, the leaked files themselves were not publicly released; without any of the actual evidence to substantiate investigations, the graph is a very thin layer of information. This highlights that the politics of missing data are at the heart of the Panama Papers stories, and of the offshore finance system more broadly. *Not* having your name recorded with your bank account is the ultimate luxury.
